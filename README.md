# VulkanComputeRayTracing  
A **(buggy)** GPU Ray tracing program, based on Vulkan Computing shader.  
## Implementation goal  
+ Finish all tasks in the book *Ray Tracing in One Weekend* (https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)  
+ Use vulkan computing shaders to do calculation  
+ Portable to various platforms  
+ C++ with pure C flavor
